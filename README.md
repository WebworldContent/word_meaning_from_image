# word_meaning_from_image
This project work is to capture all specific size words from captured image and show meanings of each word
Some times while reading we came across words that we don't know meanings and in some books some authors 
write contents full of unknow meanings , so search every time on google for each word we came across feels
sluggish to us.

So i hv made this project where we can just take image of that book page and then it will
show us all the words with respective meanings!!
